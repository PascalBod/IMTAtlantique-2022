# Exercises for session 3

## Download the exercises

In the Linux VM, open a terminal (**Main menu > Terminal**, in the task bar). In this terminal, create a directory where you will download a copy of the ESP-IDF projects used by the exercises:

```shell
$ # Be sure to be in your home directory.
$ cd ~
$ # You can create a directory named Dev, for instance.
$ mkdir Dev
$ cd Dev
$ # Download the exercises.
$ git clone git@github.com:PascalBod/IMTAtlantique-2022.git
```

Using the above commands, exercises for session 3 are downloaded in `~/Dev/IMTAtlantique-2022/exercisesForSession3`.

## Get acquainted with timers

This exercise shows how to create and use a periodic timer. Its source code is in `~/Dev/IMTAtlantique-2022/exercisesForSession3/timer_handler`.

Import the associated project into Eclipse, with **File > Import... > Espressif > Existing IDF Project**:
* In the **Import** window, after having selected **Existing IDF Project**, click the **Next >** button
* In the **Import Project** window, click the **Browse...** button, select the `timer_handler` directory and click the **Open** button
* Click the **Finish** button

In the **Project Explorer** view, you now have the `timer_handler` project. Build it, flash the ESP32 board, and open an Eclipse terminal to display the application log messages.

Look at the source code. The example uses a [FreeRTOS timer](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-software-timer.html). The timer handler function is called repeatedly, with the same period each time. 

Try to modify the application:
* change the timer period (easy!)
* try to modify the application so that the timer handler function is called after a different time period each time, for instance doubling the period after each time.

The FreeRTOS timer API is presented [here](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Software-Timer-API-Functions.html).

## Background task and ISR

This exercise simulates the reception of bytes from a serial connection. A timer is used to simulate the periodic byte reception, the timer handler playing the role of the ISR. 

Import the project into Eclipse.

The background task processes each received byte. Usually, a real process would wait for several bytes (generated by a sensor for instance) and then apply some more or less complex processing (if the sensor is a camera, the processing could be an image classification, for instance).

In the code here, we simulate a more or less long processing by waiting for a random time period.

Run the application, and observe its behavior. How do you explain what happens?
